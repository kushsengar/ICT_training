ICT Training â€“ Web Development with Python
This repository contains all the files, code samples, and mini-projects I created during my ICT Training program, where I learned and practiced Web Development using Python and its popular frameworks/libraries: Django, Flask, and Tkinter.

ðŸ“š Training Overview
The ICT Training was designed to give hands-on experience in building applications with Python.
Key topics covered:

Web Development Basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Python for Web Development

Django Framework

Flask Framework

Tkinter for GUI Applications

Connecting applications with databases (SQLite, MySQL)

Deployment basics

ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: Django, Flask

GUI Library: Tkinter

Databases: SQLite, MySQL

Tools: VS Code, Git, Browser DevTools

ðŸš€ How to Run the Projects
1.Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/kushsengar/ICT_training.git
cd ICT_training

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

3. Install dependencies (if requirements.txt is provided in the project folder)

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project

4. For Django:

python manage.py runserver
For Flask:

python app.py
For Tkinter:

python main.py
ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
By working on these projects, I learned how to:

Structure and build scalable web applications with Django and Flask

Create GUI applications using Tkinter

Connect apps to databases and perform CRUD operations

Handle routing, templates, and static files

Deploy and test Python-based applications

ðŸ“Œ Note
These files are from my ICT Training program and serve as a record of my learning journey.
They may not be production-ready, but they demonstrate the concepts and skills I practiced during the training.
